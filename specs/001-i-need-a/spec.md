## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Restaurant Information (Priority: P1)

Potential customers visit the landing page to learn about the breakfast restaurant, including its location in Hualien, opening hours, and what makes it special. They can immediately see appealing photos and basic information without any interaction required.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing essential restaurant information to attract customers. Without this, the landing page serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage URL and verifying all restaurant information (name, description, location, hours) is visible and readable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the restaurant name, tagline, and hero image
2. **Given** a user scrolls down the page, **When** they view the about section, **Then** they see a description of the restaurant and its specialties
3. **Given** a user looks for contact information, **When** they scroll to the footer, **Then** they see the address, phone number, and opening hours
4. **Given** a user wants to know the location, **When** they view the contact section, **Then** they see "Hualien, Taiwan" clearly displayed

### User Story 2 - Browse Menu Items (Priority: P2)

Customers want to see what breakfast items are available with their prices to decide if they want to visit the restaurant. They can browse through menu categories organized by type (Main Dishes, Drinks, Sides).

**Why this priority**: Showing menu items with pricing is critical for attracting customers, but the page can function without it initially (basic info alone provides value).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scrolling to the menu section and verifying that breakfast items are displayed with names and prices in NT$ organized by categories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views the menu section, **When** they scroll through items, **Then** they see menu items organized into Main Dishes, Drinks, and Sides categories
2. **Given** a user reads menu items, **When** they look at each dish, **Then** they see the dish name in both Chinese and English with the price in NT$
3. **Given** a user wants to see food categories, **When** they browse the menu, **Then** dishes are clearly grouped with category headers (主食 Main Dishes, 飲品 Drinks, 配菜 Sides)

### User Story 3 - View Location and Contact Options (Priority: P3)

Customers need to know how to reach the restaurant or find directions. They want easy access to contact methods like phone number, address, or social media links.

**Why this priority**: Contact information enhances the user experience but assumes they've already decided to visit based on P1 and P2 content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by finding and clicking contact information elements (phone link, address display) and verifying they work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to call the restaurant, **When** they click the phone number, **Then** their device initiates a call (on mobile) or displays the number (on desktop)
2. **Given** a user wants directions, **When** they click the address, **Then** they can copy it or view it on a map service
3. **Given** a user wants to follow on social media, **When** they view the footer, **Then** they see links to the restaurant's social media profiles

### Edge Cases

- What happens when images fail to load? (Alt text and placeholder styling should maintain layout)
- How does the page display on very small screens (320px width)? (Content should remain readable without horizontal scrolling)
- What happens if the menu section has no items? (Should show placeholder message)
- How does the page handle very long restaurant descriptions? (Text should wrap properly and maintain readability)
